# Project Singkat

“SINGKAT” application project created to shorten the bureaucratic flow and facilitate faster data verification in the registration of DTKS (Social Welfare Integrated Data). 

Our project will solve the way “How the application could shorten the bureaucratic flow and speed up the data verification process?” and “What are the parameters to validating if the recipient of social aid is eligible”.

Project Flow:

We use transfer learning from Xception and freeze some layer, then we use dropout to prevent from overfitting, 
The result from model is binary classification, poor and rich. For Poverty_ML model, We use Deep Neural Network to provide recommendation for social aid verificator.

# Further Development

This project still needs many improvement, start from dark theme UI compatibility, function response time, and clean code implementation. Please do pull request if necessary.
